In this course we’ll join Dr. Denis Batalov, worldwide AI/ML Tech Leader, as he shows you how to implement a machine learning pipeline using Amazon SageMaker and Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. First you will create a labeled dataset, then you’ll create a training job to train your object detection model, and finally you will use Amazon SageMaker to create and update your model.


Intended Audience
This course is intended for:

Developers and data scientists who want to create machine learning pipelines with Amazon SageMaker using the Sagemaker SDK and python.
Developers and data scientists who want to use Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth to create their own labeled datasets.

Course Objectives
In this course, you will learn how to:

Train a machine learning model using images labeled by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth
Use Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth to identify the exact location of bees on individual images in a dataset
Train the object detection model using Amazon SageMaker in-built algorithms
Use an automated hyperparameter tuning job to find an optimal set of hyperparameters

Prerequisites
We recommend that attendees of this course have the following prerequisites:

A basic understanding Amazon SageMaker (https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)
A basic understanding of the python programming language with various libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SageMaker, and Boto3
