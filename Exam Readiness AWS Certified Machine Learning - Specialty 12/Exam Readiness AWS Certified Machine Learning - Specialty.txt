This course prepares you to take the AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty exam, which validates your ability to design, implement, deploy, and maintain machine learning (ML) solutions.

In this course, you’ll learn about the logistics of the exam and the mechanics of exam questions, and you’ll explore the exam’s technical domains. You’ll review core AWS services and key concepts for the exam domains:

Data Engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis
Modeling
Machine Learning Implementation and Operations


You’ll also learn key test-taking strategies and will put them into action, taking multiple study questions. Once you’ve honed your skills, you’ll have the chance to take a quiz that will help you assess your areas of strength and weakness, so that you’ll know what to emphasize in your pre-exam studies.


Course objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

Identify your strengths and weaknesses in each exam domain so that you know what to focus on when studying for the exam
Describe the technical topics and concepts that make up each of the exam domains
Summarize the logistics and mechanics of the exam and its questions
Use effective strategies for studying and taking the exam
